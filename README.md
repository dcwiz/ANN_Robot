# ANN_Robot
I want to make a simple robot that is run by an <strike> artificial neural network </strike> this will probibly now be a q-learning algorithim.
I want to build a robot from scratch, make the pcb and progam a microcontroller so that in the end I have a amchine learning robot.
I am starting this with very little knowledge of How I will go about programming the robot.
I currently understand: C/C++, Arduino and a little about PICs, and I know how to make a pcb.
This repository will contain all the files, ideas and progress of the project.
