# ANN_Robot
I want to make a simple robot that is run by an <strike>artificial neural network</strike> this will probibly now be a q-learning algorithim.
I am starting this with very little knowledge of how I will go about programming the robot.
I currently understand: C/C++ and Arduino.
This repository will contain all the files, ideas and progress of the project.
